List the components of Hadoop 2.x and explain them in detail.

Ans.
The major components of Hadoop 2.x are:
1.HDFS
2.MapReduce
3.YARN

Hadoop2 has come up with a lot of interesting and profitable changes in
the earlier version of hadoop.
Hadoop 2 includes new enhanced features designed to improve system availability and scalability.
 
1.HDFS
The new version of Hadoop distributed file system includes High availability feature that
brings a new NameNode architecture to hadoop.
Hadoop 1.x HDFS had one namenode where data was stored in a cluster,there were high chances
of a lone namenode would become a single point of failure within a cluster.
The 2 main components in HDFS hadoop 2.x:
1.High Availability
2.HDFS Federation


        1.The High Availability used as standby system,took control of the system immediately if the primary node would fail.
The instantaneous standby system proves to be of great significance.
        2.The new HDFS federation capability allowed clusters be built out horizontally with multiple NameNodes that work 
independently but share a common data storage pool, offering better compute scaling as compared to Hadoop 1.x.


2.MapReduce
Hadoop does distributed processing of massive unstructured data sets across commodity computer clusters, in which each node 
of the cluster includes its own storage. MapReduce serves two essential functions:
 1.. It parcels out work to various nodes within the cluster or map, 
 2..It organizes and reduces the results from each node into a cohesive answer to a query.

3.YARN
The concept behind YARN is to split up functionalities of resource management and job scheduling and job monitoring into separate daemons.
The ResourceManager is the authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system.
 YARN is the prerequisite for Enterprise Hadoop, providing resource management and a central platform to deliver consistent operations, 
security, and data governance tools across Hadoop clusters.
